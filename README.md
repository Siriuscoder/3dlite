## About

Light weight 3d/2d graphics rendering helper. "Engine" is not correct word for this library. 
It is designed as adapter from low level OpenGL API to more simple high level API. This API contains some high level 
concepts like scene, material, mesh, shader.. etc. whereas OpenGL API provides low level concepts like Framebuffer, 
vertex buffer, texture buffer and others.

Lite3d library support only OpenGL graphics API as back end for GPU operations. No sound, no physics, graphics only!
One of the reason of using OpenGL API was a potential support of many OS. Windows/Linux supports now, but 
library may be simply ported on others platforms. 

## API

Library provides two API levels:
  1. Low level C API (3dlite), common graphic operations.
  2. High level C++ API (3dlitepp), user friendly C++ components and scripting API.
(See samples for more details)

## Dependencies

* [DevIL](https://github.com/DentonW/DevIL)
* [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
* [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)
* [FreeType](https://github.com/freetype/freetype)
* [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3)

## Building project

Use [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) 3.21.0 or higher. Base dependencies already provided in [deps](https://github.com/Siriuscoder/3dlite/tree/master/deps) directory (except Bullet). Hovewer on windows recomended to use vcpkg build. 

All intructions assume that /path/to/3dlite/ is root of the project.

### Build with existing dependencies (Linux)

```
$ cd /path/to/3dlite
$ mkdir build/
$ cmake --preset=Linux64_ci_gcc_release
$ cmake --build build/ --config Release
``` 

### Build with existing dependencies (Windows)

Recommended to use cmake GUI to generate Visual Studio projects on windows OR

```
$ cd /path/to/3dlite
$ mkdir build/
$ cmake --preset=Windows64_ci_release
$ cmake --build build/ --config Release
``` 

### Build using vcpkg (Linux)

```
$ cd /path/to/3dlite
$ mkdir build/
$ cmake --preset=Linux64_vcpkg
$ cmake --build build/ --config Release
``` 

### Build using vcpkg (Windows, Visual Studio 2022)

```
$ cd /path/to/3dlite
$ mkdir build/
$ cmake --preset=Windows64_vcpkg
$ cmake --build build/ --config Release
``` 
Or just call build_win_2022.bat

### All presets

* Linux64_vcpkg_debug 
* Linux64_vcpkg
* Linux64_ci_gcc_debug
* Linux64_ci_gcc_release
* Linux64_ci_clang_debug (with -fsanitize)
* Linux64_ci_clang_release
* Windows64_vcpkg_debug
* Windows64_vcpkg
* Windows64_ci_debug
* Windows64_ci_release

## Samples

After successfully compiling you can find some samples in bin directory. To provide samples work correctly you must download 
resources pack [vault.pkg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JhsirjKwMq51IBg7GknUeZLGvrVKp1Sz/view?usp=sharing) and put it to media/packs/

You can download resources for Vault_111 and Vault room sample from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10sDEAlVEK4MVDGqzJgYaqVL5O0V8kRxo/view?usp=sharing), this 7z archive contains textures and models folders, you must copy this folders to media/vault_111 and anjoy this awesome samples!

Also you able to download resources for sponza remastered scene from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rhB6k-BmfULFcVFAaw4KaPaILxeD34ne/view?usp=sharing), unpack and copy textures and models folders to media/sponza.
